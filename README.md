Effects of Temperature in Oomycete Populations using a Metagenomics Approach

## Purpose of study
The purpose of this study is to understand how oomycete populations change after soils had been incubated at 15 and 25 degrees Celsius.   Soils were dried and homogenized prior to baiting.  Our objective is to investigate whether temperature favors some oomycete species over another and to understnad the oomycete population within each field. Fields have different agricultural practice that we will utilize to see if these practices are playing a role in oomycete populations. We will also investigated two methods to detect pathogen diversity i) direct cultviation and, ii) an amplicon based metagenomic approach.  

## Methodology
Phytophthora and Pythium species produce reproductive structures called oospores that can survived in the soils and can be use for bating purposes. The oospores requires some time to break dormancy and for this reason, soils were baited following procedure from Dorrance et al. 2007. In summary, before processing soils were air dried and then grinded into fine particles to make potting easier. Soils were then flooded for 24h and then drain and dried until the desired moisture content was reached. Using polyethylene bags soils were then covered and incubated in growth chambers at 15 and 25 degrees Celsius for two weeks. Since Oospores will germinate in this period, a moderately susceptible soybean cultivar and incubated for three more days. A final flooding is then performed for 24h and then pots are transferred to the greenhouse to dry. Three to four days after flooding, diseased seedling are collected for pathogen isolation and identification. Soils from the rhizosphere of the seedlings was also collected and a total of 3 DNA extractions were performed and pooled in equimolar quantities.The ITS region was amplified using the primers ITS6 and ITS7 (previously used by Bakker et al. 2017). After PCR, libraries were prepared by the MCIC followed by Mi-Seq sequencing. Due to the high content of the oligonucleotide A and T, the run was spiked with PhiX genomic DNA.
